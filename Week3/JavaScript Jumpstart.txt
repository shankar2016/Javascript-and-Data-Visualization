JavaScript Jumpstart (optional)Tutorial review:  HTML Dog: Beginner JavaScript http://www.htmldog.com/guides/javascript/Reference: W3 Schools JavaScript: good reference guide to go back to as a refresher http://www.w3schools.com/js/Assignment: Write a program that accepts a string input by the user that includes a numeric temperature plus a letter C or F (e.g., Ò60FÓ) and converts to the opposite temperature system. Use a pair of JavaScript functions, one that converts degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit and one that converts degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius. (Hint:  look up string handling functions in the W3Schools reference.) For this initial version, take user input in a popup dialog box and provide output in the console, using console.log(). All major browsers now offer a developer interface that lets you see what's going on with the javascript, HTML, and CSS in the current web page. Find your browser's developer tools, or install Firebug (Firefox), and familiarize yourself with the console, the debugger (yes, you get a real one that can set breakpoints and show you the status of variables , etc.), and the element selector (you should be able to click an element and get a list of style rules applied to it). Coding in Javascript without developer tools is like trying to draw a perfect circle with nothing but a pencil; using a tool makes all the difference.
